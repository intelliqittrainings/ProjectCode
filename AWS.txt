VPC's
=========
ipv4   32 bit
ipv6   128 bit

2 power of 32 ip's only can be created

ipv4 is divided into  parts
255 is the maximum no

cidr   classless interdomain routing
This idicates the size of network and series

10.0.0.0/24      32-24=8
          2 to power of 8 ie 256 ips ip's can be generated

10.0.0.0/23   32-23=9      512 ips can be genrated
since 255 is the  larget number it will effect the second number in the ip range

10.0.0.0
10.0.0.1
10.0.0.2
10.0.0.255
10.0.1.0
.
.
10.0.1.255
10.0.2.0
..
10.0.2.255


VPC--->dived further into subnets
changing part of ip is called host address
constant part is called network address


Services--->VPC
oyour vps--->create vpc
name of vpc
cidr   10.0.0.0/244--->create vpc


sunets--->create sunet-->select vpc
name for subnet--->Leave the availability zone
cidr block--->10.0.0.0/25  (ie 128 machines)
--->create

create another subnet

cidr block  10.0.0.128/25--->create

subnet is always associated with route table

internet gateway

create internet gateway
name--->create

select gateway--Action--->attach to vpc

subnets--->select a subnet--->route table
click on route tbale id
